# PF2E Third Action Suggester

A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module for the [Pathfinder Second Edition](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e) system.

When it's your turn in combat, a floating panel appears suggesting smart options for your third action — based on your character's abilities, skills, feats, equipped gear, and what's actually happening on the battlefield.

---

## Features

- **Automatic suggestions** on turn start, tailored to the current actor
- **Rollable actions** — click the dice button to roll directly from the panel
- **Colour-coded cards** by category (Athletics, Social, Defensive, Knowledge, Stealth)
- **Skill rank indicator** on each card showing your current proficiency
- **Archives of Nethys links** on every suggestion
- **Condition awareness** — suppresses irrelevant actions (e.g. no Grapple suggestions if the target is already Restrained; Escape surfaces automatically when you are Grabbed)
- **Create a Diversion variant picker** — choose Distracting Words, Gesture, or Trick before rolling
- **Persistent panel** — remembers its position and expanded/collapsed state across page refreshes
- **Keybind** (default `Alt+Shift+S`) to open or close the panel manually

### Action Catalog

| Category | Actions |
|---|---|
| Athletics | Trip, Shove, Grapple, Disarm, Reposition, Escape, Tumble Through |
| Social | Demoralize, Feint, Create a Diversion, Bon Mot |
| Defensive | Raise a Shield, Take Cover, Battle Medicine |
| Knowledge | Recall Knowledge, Aid |
| Stealth | Sneak |

> **Design principle:** Third Strikes are never suggested. The −10 MAP penalty makes almost any maneuver, utility, or defensive action a better use of your third action.
